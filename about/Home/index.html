This can overwhelm the user, the physician, by making all data have equal visual weight.","solution":"Create a more welcoming display that allows important information to be more prominent and less relevant information to be tucked away neatly. The improvement in user experience for physicians will lessen stress and burnout.","team":[{"name":"Snehi Vallurupalli","image":"./assets/snehi-thumbnail-big.png","role":"Founder","description":"Snehi works as a software engineer for a consulting firm in Atlanta and has engineering degree from Georgia Tech."},{"name":"Mark Hoffman","image":"./assets/markhoffman.jpg","role":"Founder","description":"Mark is a practicing Neurologist in Atlanta."},{"name":"Sharat Vallurupalli","image":"./assets/sharat-vallurupalli.jpg","role":"Founder","description":"Sharat is a practicing psychiatrist and also graduated from East Tennessee State University with a BA in Studio Art."},{"name":"Raghu Sunkara","image":"./assets/raghusunkara.jpeg","role":"Founder","description":"Raghu has worked for several start ups and has been a part of the tech start up community in Atlanta for many years.
